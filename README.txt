Usage

Additionally, a platform-specific executable may be automatically generated
on installation.

Also try running the --help option to the executables after installation and
for a command-line example.

Programmers may use the executable in bin as a guide and template for how to
program against the cmcpy API.

Some documentation of the cmcpy API is available within the "doc"
